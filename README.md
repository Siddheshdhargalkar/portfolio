## About me
I‚Äôm a Data Analyst with a strong foundation in data analytics, business intelligence, and a basic understanding of full-stack development. I specialize in transforming raw, messy datasets into clear, actionable insights using tools like Python, SQL, Power BI, and Advanced Excel. My core skills include data cleaning, exploratory analysis, predictive modeling, and dashboard creation‚Äîfocused on delivering business value through data.

A significant part of my work has been centered around Dubai and UAE-based datasets, reflecting my goal to contribute to the region‚Äôs data-driven growth. I‚Äôve led end-to-end projects analyzing real estate trends, food delivery performance, banking stock forecasts, and public health data. These projects have helped build my domain expertise in local industries.

Academically, I hold a Bachelor‚Äôs in Computer Engineering and have earned certifications from Google, Microsoft, and Udemy in data analytics, SQL, and visualization. I also co-authored published research in Springer Nature, where we developed a deep learning framework for cryptocurrency price prediction using LSTM, GRU, sentiment analysis, and market signals.

Currently based in Dubai (with a valid 2-year residence visa), I‚Äôm actively exploring opportunities that allow me to apply my technical and analytical skill set to real-world challenges‚Äîespecially within real estate, fintech, healthcare, and smart city domains.

## üìù Publications

**"Optimized Deep Learning Framework for Cryptocurrency Price Prediction"**   

[Published in **Springer Nature**, Vol. 6, Article No. 67, January 2025](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42979-024-03611-9)

**Tools**: Python, Deep Learning, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

In this published research, I co-developed an advanced deep learning framework aimed at improving the accuracy of cryptocurrency price prediction. The study focused on three major cryptocurrencies‚ÄîMonero, Ethereum, and Litecoin‚Äîand applied two powerful neural network architectures: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). To enhance predictive performance, we incorporated external market indicators including the Direction Algorithm (to capture the influence of Bitcoin as a parent coin), Change Point Detection using the PELT algorithm (to identify sudden market shifts), and sentiment analysis via the VADER algorithm (to quantify the impact of cryptocurrency-related news).

By combining these diverse data sources, our proposed models (VADER + Direction + PELT integrated with LSTM/GRU) achieved significantly lower error rates compared to standard models‚Äîfor instance, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as low as 1.11 in the GRU model for Monero. This multi-layered approach not only demonstrated superior accuracy but also provided a more holistic view of market dynamics. The framework serves as a strong foundation for data-driven decision-making in financial analytics and highlights the power of combining deep learning with external data signals in time-series forecasting.
